Program summary: 
I first added a couple helping function to simply the codes for both DC and strassen such as the addMatrix and subMatrix function. 
For this lab, I used gpt to wrote the output file method (the ofstream and saving method) and I asked gpt for a little inspiration
for the strassen method to learn about the logic. I wasn't very sure about where to incooporate the M matrices at first.
